**Detecting Textual Similarity**

## Important Notes
* Due October 2, by 11:59 p.m.
* This is an *individual* assignment.
* This assignment has a weight of 6% towards your final *raw* grade.
* Get started by using [this GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/k3UhZPR3) to obtain a repository.

## Background

The goal of this assignment is to build a small system that is capable of detecting similar documents using the cosine similarity metric. In addition to implementing the required methods, you will need to develop robust testing strategies for your work and demonstrate code coverage.

More details of what is expected can be found in the [more detailed specification document](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6l7kddmr3ep50zc/mp-cosineSimilarity.pdf?raw=1) and by inspecting the provided skeleton code.

## Submitting your work

This assignment has two submission components:

1. source code via GitHub;
2. source code for `DocumentSimilarity.java` as a PDF file for peer review, submitted via Canvas.

### Submitting source code

To submit source code, from the `f17-mp2-<your username>` directory, use the following `git` commands:

```git
git add src/*
git commit -m "MP2 submission"
git push
```

You can push your work to GitHub as many times as you want until the assignment deadline. We recommend that you commit and push your work to GitHub regularly (with every significant change to your source code) so that you have a history of changes and a backup in case your own device fails. Only your final submission will be used for marking. (You can also change the git commit message each time to something more meaningful than just "MP2 submission".)

> Note that the `git` commands in the previous step were provided as an example. You should get comfortable with using `git` as the situation demands.

### Code review

On [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/), upload a PDF file with the code for `DocumentSimilarity.java` alone. Each submission will be assigned, at random, to a peer for code review. This step will be anonymous so ensure that you do not have your name or other identifying information in the file that you upload.
